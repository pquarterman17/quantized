"""Read Origin ``.opju`` (CPYUA, 2018+) projects: worksheet data → DataStruct.

The worksheet-column codec is solved (``opju_codec.py``): each column is an
FPC-compressed float64 stream, located by its LEB128-varint record header and
labelled by the nearest preceding ``<Book>_<Col>[@sheet]`` dataset name. Books
are grouped and assembled exactly like the ``.opj`` reader (shared ``_group``
/ ``_build_book`` / ``_inventory``). Column long-names/units/comments come
from the CPYUA windows section (``windows_opju.py``, plan item 10) the same
way `.opj`'s windows-section metadata feeds ``_build_book`` — designation-X
becomes the x axis, real labels/units/comments attach where a book's window
section can be structurally confirmed, and book display titles recover from
the embedded import filename where available. Columns/books that can't be
confirmed keep the Origin short-designation fallback (A, B, C…) rather than
being guessed at.

Plan item 4's report-sheet residue (``opju_reports.py``) is folded in the
same way ``.opj``'s ``text_cols``/``report_cols`` are: a book made entirely
of report-sheet columns (e.g. a fit's "FitNL1" sheet, with zero
plausible-numeric columns of its own) still gets its own pseudo-book via
``_build_book``'s empty-``cols`` branch, rather than being silently dropped
for having nothing in ``books``.
