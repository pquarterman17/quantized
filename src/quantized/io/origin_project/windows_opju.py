"""Extract per-column long-names/units from the ``.opju`` (CPYUA) windows section.

The CPYUA container's worksheet windows section is not `.opj`'s CPY block
stream (see ``docs/origin_re/opj_windows_section.md``) — it uses its own
tag/length framing that this module does not fully parse. What IS pinned,
validated against Origin's own exported ground truth across five real
corpus files (XAS, RockingCurve, UnpolPlots, "Fixed Lambdas SI", plus the
``rosetta_*`` specimens — 145/145 names, units, and comments matched):

* Every worksheet column carries a 2-byte **plot-designation marker**:
  ``21 51`` for X, ``21 61`` for Y, ``30 61`` for Y-error — the same
  marker-byte + display-code convention `.opj` uses at property-block
  offsets 0x25/0x26 (see ``opj_windows_section.md`` sec 4.1), reused inside
  CPYUA's own framing.
* A fixed-shape run (default column-format doubles) follows every marker,
  then an OPTIONAL length-prefixed embedded blob (``<len><tag=0x01><bytes>
  <NUL>``) carrying that column's ``ColumnInfo``/``ImportFile`` storage
  (only present for imported-file columns — a long file path, possibly
  using Origin's internal string back-reference shorthand which this
  module never tries to decode), then the REAL label record in the SAME
  ``<len:u8><tag:u8><text><NUL>`` shape (``len`` counts tag+text+NUL).
  ``text`` splits on ``\\r\\n`` into long_name/unit/comment (0-3 rows); a
  zero-length text (tag ``0x01``, no ``\\r\\n``) means "no label" (e.g. an
  unlabeled Y column) and some columns carry only a bare long name with no
  ``\\r\\n`` at all (single-row form).
* Every column emits its own marker (+ optional label) record, in true
  sheet column order (A, B, C, ...) — INCLUDING columns that never decode
  as data (e.g. a blank/text column between two decoded numeric ones).
  That is why association is by ORDINAL POSITION within one book's
  contiguous marker run, mapped through Origin's column lettering
  (A, B, ... Z, AA, AB, ... — wide measurement sheets run well past Z),
  rather than by parsing an internal short-name field — no such field was
  pinned for CPYUA (unlike `.opj`'s offset-0x12 short name). Each book is
  anchored INDEPENDENTLY (not via a forward-only cursor): a project's book
  windows are not in decoded-book order, so a monotonic cursor drops every
  book whose window sits before an already-anchored one (the Hc2 project
  interleaves 30+ of them). Anchors are exact, so independent search is safe.
* Each book's own marker run is anchored via ONE OF: (a) the embedded
  ``ColumnInfo``/``ImportFile`` path's filename, alnum-stripped and matched
  against the book's known short name (handles Origin's habit of dropping
  underscores when deriving a book short name from an imported filename,
  e.g. ``bl11_YIGPy_032.dat`` -> book ``bl11YIGPy032``); or (b) a
  ``<len=namelen+2> 00 00 <name>`` window/book-header reference that
  appears even for books never imported from a file (manually-typed
  sheets, e.g. the ``rosetta_*`` specimens).

Positional guessing is NOT used to *detect* a label: every accepted record
matches the exact ``<len><tag><text><NUL>`` byte count PLUS a character-
class + known-internal-token filter (rejects embedded blob fragments like
a truncated ``ResultsLog``/``OriginStorage`` token, which the length-prefix
match alone can accidentally land inside). Association across a book's
columns IS positional, but only after that book's boundary is independently
confirmed by anchor (a) or (b) above — never by scanning the whole file for
ASCII runs. When no anchor is found, or the marker run doesn't cover every
column ``opju_codec.scan_columns`` actually decoded for that book, the book
is left out of the result entirely (A/B/C fallback stays in force) rather
than guessed at.

See ``docs/origin_re/opju_container.md`` for the full byte-level trail.
