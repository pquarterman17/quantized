"""Origin auto-generated report-sheet columns for ``.opju`` (CPYUA) — plan
item 4's report-sheet residue, the ``.opju`` sibling of ``opj.py``'s
``decode_report_strings`` (``container.py``).

Origin's FitLinear/NLFit X-Functions auto-generate report sheets ("FitNL1",
"FitLinearCurve1", …) whose cells hold a variable-length
``cell://<Section>.<Row>.<Field>`` reference string (e.g.
``"cell://Parameters.Slope.Value"``, naming *which* fit statistic that cell
represents) rather than a plain float64. ``.opj``'s version of this family
overflows a fixed 8-byte value area (``container.decode_inline_text`` has to
drop it); ``.opju`` stores the SAME conceptual content in its own record
framing, sharing ``opju_codec``'s ``0a 05 <…> ff ff <…>`` marker but taking a
completely different branch after it.

**The grammar** (pinned against ``specimens/fitreport2.opju`` — a known
linear fit, x=1..8, slope -1.5, intercept 9.5 — whose ``FitNL1`` report sheet
has 28 columns, ``FitNLCurve1`` has 11): a normal numeric record is ``ff ff
<varint> 00 <ZigZag-varint segments>`` (``opju_codec``'s grammar: the byte
right after the row-count varint is ``0x00``, then the segment list decodes
straight to float64s). A REPORT column instead has ``0x01`` at that exact
position — the discriminator, checked at the same byte offset the numeric
codec already tests. What follows is *not* ``opju_codec``'s FPC/repeat
segment grammar at all: a single ZigZag-varint segment count, then, if
negative (``-m``), ``m`` consecutive ``<len:u8><ASCII bytes>`` strings
(``len=0`` is a valid, blank report cell — most report columns hold only a
handful of populated rows out of the segment's ``m``). A positive segment
count was observed on 2 of ``FitNL1``'s 28 columns (its first two, with no
``cell://`` content at all) and its shape is not understood — those columns
are honestly dropped, never guessed at.

**Validation:** every one of ``FitNL1``'s 26 populated columns decodes
cleanly (the reference strings match exactly what
``tools/origin_trial/generate_specimens3.py``'s ``fitreport2`` generator
produced — ``Notes.*`` metadata, ``Input.R1/R2.C1..C4``,
``Parameters.A/B/xintercept.{Value,Error,tValue,Prob,Dependency}``,
``RegStats.C1.*``, ``Summary.R1.*``, ``ANOVAs.*``); the 2 non-text columns
are honestly dropped. **What this does NOT recover:** the fit's actual
computed numbers (e.g. Slope = -1.5) are not present as a plain float64
anywhere near these records (checked directly: neither raw nor FPC-compact
encodings of 9.5/-1.5 appear in the report-sheet byte range) — Origin
appears to cache them in a separate internal structure this module does not
decode. See ``docs/origin_project_format.md`` "Non-double column values" for
the full writeup and the byte-level trail.
