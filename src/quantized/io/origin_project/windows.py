"""Extract per-column metadata from the ``.opj`` windows section.

Worksheet *window definitions* live in the same block stream as the column
data, after the datasets section. Each worksheet window opens with a header
block (``00 00 <BookShort> 00 …``, long name ending at the ``@${`` storage
marker) and contains, per column, a **property block** (≥500 B; designation at
``0x11``, NUL-terminated short name at ``0x12``) immediately followed by a
**label-text block** (``LongName\\r\\nUnit\\r\\nComment``, cut at ``@${``).
Column ``S`` of book ``B`` maps to the dataset named ``"B_S"``.

A property block's byte 0x06 varies with the column's storage flavour --
``0x09`` for a plain sheet-1 column, ``0x0B`` for a formula/derived column
*and* for every column of an auto-generated report sheet (FitLinear/FitNL's
"Parameters"/"Notes"/etc. sheets) -- so it does not distinguish sheet
identity; both values are accepted (plan item: report-sheet leak fix).

**Multi-sheet books** (a workbook with a report/curve sheet appended after
the real data, e.g. Origin's FitLinear auto-adds "FitLinear1"/
"FitLinearCurve1" siblings to the sheet it fits) restart column lettering at
"A" for each extra sheet, and *also* reuse the very same 0x0B property-block
shape as a real formula column -- so neither the storage-flavour byte nor a
short-name repeat is a reliable, early sheet-boundary signal on its own (a
report sheet's own property/label blocks can front-run a repeat detection
by many columns). The real signal is a fixed 365-byte **sheet/layer
sub-header** block carrying ``Pd<Name>\\0`` at a constant offset (0xD0) --
one appears at the very start of every worksheet sheet (and every graph
layer, tagged ``Pd1``/``Pd2``/…) inside a window's block span. The *second*
one seen since the enclosing window header is the true start of sheet 2+;
everything from there on (property blocks, labels, formulas) is excluded.
Validated against Moke.opj's ``Book4`` (Sheet1 / FitLinear1 /
FitLinearCurve1 — three ``Pd...`` markers, one per sheet, exactly bracketing
each sheet's real column-property-block run) and every single-sheet corpus
book (exactly one marker, at the window's very start). Older-format (CPYA
4.3227) files carry no such marker at all; the short-name-repeat guard is
kept as a fallback for that case (unverified whether any 4.3227 file in the
corpus has a real multi-sheet book -- none observed to date).

Byte layout validated against the local corpus — see
``docs/origin_re/opj_windows_section.md`` (plan item 1).
